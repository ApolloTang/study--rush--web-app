### Note üìù üìù 

- It shold be noted that I am not using `heft-webpack` for my web-application. The web-application is transpile by babel; however, all its dependencies (React components and  non-React dependencies) are managed by rigged heft. See [discussion](https://rushstack.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262522-heft/topic/.28play.20nice.20with.20babel.29.20how.20to.20run.20heft.20task.20manually.3F)

- Another feature worth mention is I am using [typescript's Project References](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html#:~:text=Project%20references%20are%20a%20new,in%20new%20and%20better%20ways.). Also see [this](https://github.com/microsoft/rushstack/issues/2604).  With this set up, jump to definition in IDE works without prebuild.
